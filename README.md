- pillars.py: the puzzle information and my solution, analysis, and an auto-solver to a rotating pillars puzzle from a videogame I played called Sonic Frontiers
There are four pillars. You can rotate each pillar 45 degrees clockwise and counter clockwise. But, there are rules.

Rotating pillar one rotates pillar two the same distance
Rotating pillar two rotates pillar four the same distance
Rotating pillar three rotates pillar one and pillar two the same distance
Rotating pillar four rotates pillar three the same distance
The goal is to rotate each pillar to a certain orientation. What's the most efficient way to solve this? (Hint: I used algebra and a greedy approach)
